# UMass Lowell Beamer Theme

This is a beamer presentation template I use for University of
Massachusetts Lowell-flavored slides. This is not an official template
for the university, but the title page is based on the official
Powerpoint template and the color scheme uses the official colors.

# Installation

To install, copy these files to somewhere in `TEXMFHOME` or
`TEXMFLOCAL`. If you are not sure where these are on your system, you
can find out using this command:

```bash
kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFHOME
```
